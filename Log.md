# Things I Learned
I learned how to use css a bit more effectively, I also learned the amount of time and thought that is
needed to create even the most simple of websites. I also learned about Mac's newest and second newest os.
There were a couple of problems i encountered using css that i couldnt figure out but they weren't a huge deal.
I probably couldve found a way to incorporate the questions a bit more than just at the very end saying who should use this OS and it being
made for the same person. I also learned about alot of hardware such as that motherboards keep computers from crashing and that powersupplies
help keep computers from overheating. One challenge i found was that at the beginning i tried to use java script but there was so much of 
it I had to learn to do what i wanted and i ended up having to give up on it because i ran out of time.


# Things i still want to learn
I still want to learn Java Script and how to make better use of css and fix any problems im encountering.
I also want to learn more about which kinds of hardware do what. I also want to learn what good types of hardware are and why
especially so i can bring some of this knowledge into my everyday life in case i ever need a replacement for the computer i use.
Also if possible i'd like to learn about different peripherals and what makes them good.
